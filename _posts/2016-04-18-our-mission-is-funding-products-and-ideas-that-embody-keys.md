Keys4Change is a non-profit organization thats main focus is giving back to organizations that affect great change in people's lives.    

Our mission is funding products and ideas that embody "keys" that motivate, inspire or teach people how to affectively change their lives for the better.

The Keys4Change product line embodies that principle.  Every designer piece crafted with our symbolic "skeleton key logo" is a gorgeous designer fashion showcase of your commitment to a Keys4Change favorite charitable organization.

A percentage of every Keys4Change purchase goes directly to the organization to change lives where it matters most.
